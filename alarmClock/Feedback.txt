Hello Roman Congratulation on your Hackaton project. I liked that you combined the learned on class and whent further 
 creating a chrome extension. Then when they accept it please let me know so i can complete see it working.
If then they will se the alarm page i will recommend to add some css to create an entire page with a title and 
more user friendly to understand what every part of your alarm is doing. Could be with some pop ups messages or 
using legends. About your Javascrypt very well done using DOM and forms manipulation and event listener. 

Keep going with the amazing job you are doing.
